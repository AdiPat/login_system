This exercise is an easy signing-in process. You will to developed the 
front-end and the back-end. You need to fullfil the next requirements:
- you can do the front-end for web or mobile (Android or iOS)
- the back-end must be written in kotlin, java, swift, ruby or python.
- there will be 2 front-end views: the signing-in form and the logged-in view
- the logged-in view must be only visible when the user has been logged-in
- the signing-in form must ask for an username and a password
- the back-end must have a REST API with 2 methods:
  - login (POST): that will check the user and password and return an authentication
    token
  - hello (GET): that will return true if the authentication token is valid
- the authentication token must be saved in the client side when the user has
  signed-in before
- the user and password can be hardoced in the backend code or read from an
  external source (a file or a database for example).
- for the authentication token you can use https://jwt.io/, if you use 
  something else you must include a small description of what have you done

The goal of this exercise is to see your technical and communication skills.
When you reply with the results please include any documentation and code
necessary to understand and replicate your results. You should not spend
too much time making the front-end more beautiful or making the backend 
faster, we are more interested in the process you followed and that the
final result satisfy the requirements.

You must return a zip file that must contain a README.txt file describing 
what you send to us and an ANSWERS.txt with your answers to these questions:

- How long did you spend on the homework test?
- What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you did not
spend much time on the assignment, then use this as an opportunity to explain
what you would add.
- Which parts did you spend the most time with?
- How did you find the test overall?
- Among all the Deep Learning areas which one do you think will have more 
impact on the business in the next years and why?

You must use English for the answers and any documentation you create.

Once finished, send the solution to careers@serendeepia.com with your name
and the position as the subject of the email.
